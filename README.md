# Go Language Learning

This repository serves as my personal learning resource for the Go programming language. Here, I document my journey in understanding and mastering Go through various example programs. Each Go file in this repository represents my exploration of a specific concept or feature within the Go language, ranging from fundamental syntax to more complex topics.

I created this repository to:

- **Log my learning progress**: Each program acts as a practical record of what I've learned and understood.
- **Deepen my understanding of concepts**: By writing and testing the code myself, I can solidify my grasp of each Go concept.
- **Serve as a quick reference**: This repository is a place where I can quickly refer back to code examples for specific Go features or patterns.

Each `.go` file here is designed to be a self-contained example or focused on a single aspect, making it easy to review and learn from.

## How to Run the Code Examples

To run any of the Go programs from this repository, ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once Go is installed, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where the `.go` file is located, and execute the following command:

```bash
go run <filename>.go
```
