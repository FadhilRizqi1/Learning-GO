### `Learning-Go`
This folder contains various Go programs covering fundamental concepts and features of the Go programming language. Each file demonstrates a specific topic, acting as a practical example for learning and reference.

**Key Topics Covered:**
* **Basic Syntax & Data Types**:
    * `helloworld.go`: The classic "Hello, World!" program in Go. 
    * `variable.go`: Basic examples of declaring and initializing variables in Go. 
    * `constant.go`: Illustrates how to declare and use constants in Go. 
    * `number.go`: Simple examples of integer and floating-point number types. 
    * `string.go`: Basic string operations, including length and accessing characters. 
    * `boolean.go`: Basic example of boolean data types (`true`, `false`) in Go. 
    * `type-declarations.go`: Shows how to create custom type declarations in Go. 
    * `conversion.go`: Examples of type conversion between different data types in Go. 
* **Operators**:
    * `math-operation.go`: Basic mathematical operations and assignment operators in Go. 
    * `comparation-operator.go`: Demonstrates various comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) in Go. 
    * `boolean-operator.go`: Illustrates the use of boolean operators (`&&`, `||`) in Go. 
* **Control Flow**:
    * `if.go`: Examples of `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditional statements. 
    * `switch.go`: Demonstrates different forms of `switch` statements, including `switch` with an expression and `switch` with a short statement. 
    * `for.go`: Covers different forms of `for` loops in Go, including traditional loops, `for-range` with slices, and `for-range` with maps. 
    * `break.go`: Shows how the `break` statement works within a `for` loop to terminate it prematurely. 
    * `continue.go`: Shows how the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next. 
* **Data Structures**:
    * `array.go`: Demonstrates array declaration, initialization, accessing elements, and using `len()` with arrays. 
    * `slice.go`: Examples of using slices, including creating, appending, and understanding capacity. 
    * `map.go`: Examples of using maps (key-value pairs) in Go. 
    * `struct.go`: Examples of defining and using structs (custom data types) in Go. 
    * `struct-method.go`: Shows how to define methods for custom struct types. 
* **Functions**:
    * `function.go`: Basic function definition and calling in Go. 
    * `function-parameter.go`: Examples of defining and using functions with parameters. 
    * `function-return-value.go`: Simple example of a function returning a single value. 
    * `function-return-multiple-value.go`: Shows how a Go function can return multiple values. 
    * `function-return-named-value.go`: Example of functions returning named values. 
    * `function-variadic.go`: Demonstrates variadic functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. 
    * `function-as-value.go`: Demonstrates assigning functions to variables in Go. 
    * `function-as-parameter.go`: Shows how to pass functions as parameters to other functions in Go. 
    * `function-anonymous.go`: Illustrates the use of anonymous functions in Go, including passing them as parameters. 
    * `closure.go`: Example demonstrating closures in Go, where an inner function retains access to variables from its outer scope. 
    * `function-recursive.go`: Provides an example of a recursive function for calculating factorial. 
* **Pointers**:
    * `pointer.go`: Introduction to pointers in Go, including declaring, dereferencing, and using `new()`. 
    * `pointer-as-parameter.go`: Shows how to pass pointers to functions to modify the original value. 
    * `pointer-method.go`: Demonstrates how to define methods with pointer receivers in Go. 
* **Interfaces**:
    * `interface.go`: Demonstrates the implementation and use of interfaces in Go with custom types. 
    * `interface-empty.go`: Explores the concept of empty interfaces (`interface{}`) which can hold values of any type. 
    * `interface-error.go`: Shows how to handle errors using the `error` interface in Go. 
* **Error Handling & Concurrency Primitives**:
    * `defer.go`: Demonstrates the `defer` statement, which ensures a function call is executed just before the surrounding function returns. 
    * `panic.go`: Demonstrates how to use `panic` to stop program execution immediately. 
    * `recover.go`: Illustrates how to use `recover` to handle panics and prevent program crashes. 
* **Others**:
    * `comment.go`: Provides examples of single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/**/`) comments in Go. 
    * `import.go`: Demonstrates how to import and use functions and variables from other packages. 
    * `nil.go`: Explains the concept of `nil` in Go, particularly with maps. 
    * `package-initialization.go`: Illustrates package initialization using the `init()` function. 
    * `type-assertions.go`: Explains how to use type assertions and type switches with `interface{}`.
